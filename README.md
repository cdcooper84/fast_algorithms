# Computer modeling with fast algorithms
This repo contains material for the course "Computer modeling with fast algorithms", offered to graduate students in the Mechanical Engineering Department at Universidad Técnica Federico Santa María, in Valparaíso, Chile.

This course covers fast algorithms that are commonly used in computer simulations. More specifically, we will study the following algorithms: Multigrid, Fast Fourier Transform, Treecode, Fast Multipole Method, Ewald Summation, and H-matrices.
